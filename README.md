The entire repository is based out of the book:
"The C Programming Language, 2nd Edition".

This main folder contains all the program examples sorted by
page (001, 002 ... and so on).

When it's a lesson it'll be the page-name
(example: 006-hello-world.c).

When it's an exercise it'll be the page-exercise
(example: 001-1.1.c).

The file called "testing-around.c" has NO reference to any pages
that's because its for testing of course and I'll save the code
to a proper dedicated file (assuming I don't scratch it).

Some projects are my own custom spinoffs and they could be related
so the book (if they are they'll be named via page-name) or
they could just be some random C programs that I decided to make
I would abstain from adding those types of apps and there probably
won't be any of them, but I'm still mentioning it here in case
there is.
